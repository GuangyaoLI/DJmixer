Introduction
-----
This project tried to use four sonic sensors to make a fun and convenient music mixer that can be connected to headphones or speakers. 
The two sensors are a group, and there are two groups in the project. 
For each set of sensors,
one sensor controls three different music, and the other sensor of the group controls the speed and volume of the music.
Try using this product to create unique music in the party with your friends！
